# SVM


### Support Vector Machine
    - Supervised Algorithm, where one need to find a hyperplane that best separates two classes.
    - It tries to maximizes the distance form the nearest points of all the classes.
    - It Used with Classification,Regression and Outliers Detection.
 
### Variations of SVM
    -- Linear SVM used with linearly seperable data
    -- Non-linear SVM used with non linearly seperable data.
    
### Kernel Trick
      kernel trick is widely used in the SVM model to bridge linearity and non-linearity.
      It allows us to operate in the original feature space without computing the coordinates of the data in a higher dimensional space.
     
### Kernel Functions
      Linear
      Polynomial
      RBF
      Sigmoid
